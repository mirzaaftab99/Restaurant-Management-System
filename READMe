My team consisted of team leader Mst. Raaid and members Mst. Arif and Mst. Obaid.
We, under the guidance of Mr. Imran Shaikh, were able to mimic a Restaurant
Database System which not only used MySQL as the back end, but PHP as the
language connecting it along with HTML usage on the web pages. The thing which
set us apart from other programmers was the integration of the high level technique of
integrating AJAX into product.

The product took 5 weeks to come into existence with the hard work of the team. The ambitious efforts of the team were duly recognized and hence secured Second Position in the Mini Project Exhibition and received a cash prize of INR 1,000/- by the functionary authorities.



This was made by: Raaid Kharbe, Obaid Sayyed, Arif Shaikh, and Aftab Mirza during Second Year Diploma (We were just learning how to code in C/C++).
